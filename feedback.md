# Code Review Feedback

## Critical Issues

### 1. ExUnit Formatter Implementation
**File**: `lib/wanderer_app/test_monitor.ex:11-25`

Your ExUnitFormatter module currently only implements `init/1` and `handle_cast/2`, but the ExUnit.Formatter behaviour requires additional callbacks: `handle_call/3`, `handle_info/2`, and `terminate/2`. 

**Fix**: Add the `@behaviour ExUnit.Formatter` declaration at the top of the module and implement the missing callbacks with appropriate stub implementations:
- `handle_call/3` should reply with `{:reply, :ok, state}`
- `handle_info/2` should return `{:noreply, state}`
- `terminate/2` should return `:ok`

This will prevent runtime errors and ensure proper message handling.

### 2. Database Migration Security Issue
**File**: `priv/repo/migrations/20250714071923_fix_webhook_secret_column.exs:12-22`

**Context**: The migration is transitioning from an encrypted `encrypted_secret` column to a plain text `secret` column to avoid AshCloak issues in testing environments.

**Issue**: The migration removes encryption for webhook secrets and lacks a data migration step to preserve existing data.

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Implemented proper AshCloak encryption for webhook secrets:

**Changes Made**:
1. **Removed problematic migration** (`20250714071923_fix_webhook_secret_column.exs`) that introduced the security issue
2. **Added proper AshCloak configuration** to `MapWebhookSubscription` resource with `cloak` block
3. **Restored original encrypted design** - the initial migration already had the correct `encrypted_secret` column

**Implementation Details**:
- Added `cloak` block with `vault(WandererApp.Vault)`, `attributes([:secret])`, and `decrypt_by_default([:secret])`
- Uses proper `encrypted_secret` column in database (AshCloak standard from original migration)
- Resource still marks field as `sensitive? true` for additional protection
- Clean migration history without conflicting changes

**Result**: Webhook secrets are now properly encrypted at rest using the original secure design.

## Infrastructure & CI/CD Issues

### 3. GitHub Actions Cache Version
**File**: `.github/workflows/test.yml:44-51`

The GitHub Actions cache step uses the outdated version `actions/cache@v3`.

**Fix**: Update the version to the latest stable release, such as `actions/cache@v3.1` or the current recommended version, by modifying the uses field accordingly to ensure you are using the most recent improvements and fixes.

## API Controller Issues

### 5. Map Systems Connections Controller - Input Validation
**File**: `lib/wanderer_app_web/controllers/api/map_systems_connections_controller.ex:81-101`

**Context**: This controller provides a combined endpoint for retrieving map systems and connections data in a single response, which is critical for the EVE Online mapping tool's real-time functionality.

**Issue**: Missing input validation for the `map_id` parameter and no rate limiting on the show action.

**Fix**: Add input validation to ensure the map_id parameter is in the expected format before processing it, returning an error response if invalid. Additionally, implement rate limiting on the show action to prevent abuse of this potentially expensive operation, using a plug or middleware to limit the number of requests per client within a time window.

### 6. OpenAPI Schema Inconsistency
**File**: `lib/wanderer_app_web/controllers/api/map_systems_connections_controller.ex:125-155`

**Context**: The Wanderer API uses OpenAPI/Swagger for documentation, which is crucial for external integrations and developer experience.

**Issue**: The `format_system` and `format_connection` functions include fields like `tag`, `description`, `labels`, `inserted_at`, `updated_at`, and `ship_size_type` that are missing from the OpenAPI schema documentation (lines 42-74).

**Fix**: Either remove these extra fields from the formatting functions to match the schema or update the OpenAPI schema to include these fields so the documentation accurately reflects the actual API response.

### 7. Error Handling and Query Optimization
**File**: `lib/wanderer_app_web/controllers/api/map_systems_connections_controller.ex:103-123`

**Context**: This endpoint handles potentially large datasets for map systems and connections, which is performance-critical for the mapping tool.

**Issue**: The current error handling masks important errors with a catch-all clause and uses two separate `Ash.read!` calls that may raise unhandled exceptions.

**Fix**: Refactor to replace `Ash.read!` with `Ash.read` to handle errors explicitly without exceptions, remove the catch-all rescue clause to avoid masking errors, and optimize by combining the queries or using Ash's preloading features to load systems and connections in a single query for better performance.

## GenServer and Supervision Issues





In lib/wanderer*app_web/controllers/plugs/check_json_api_auth.ex around lines
116 to 141, the test token validation creates users with predictable hash
patterns that could be exploited. To fix this, replace the predictable
"test_hash*" concatenation with a securely generated random string or token for
the user hash, such as using a cryptographically secure random generator,
ensuring test tokens remain secure while preserving test functionality.

In lib/wanderer_app_web/open_api.ex around lines 78 to 79, the OpenAPI schema
references a MapSystem that does not exist, causing a missing schema definition
error. To fix this, either create a new module WandererApp.Api.MapSystem using
Ash.Resource with AshJsonApi.Resource extension and set its json_api type to
"map_systems", or update the OpenAPI reference at these lines to point to an
existing schema like MapSystemStructure or MapSystemComment, or alternatively
add a manual schema definition for MapSystem in the OpenAPI spec.

In the Makefile around lines 56, 60, 64, and 68, each test target (test-smoke,
test-comprehensive, test-performance, test-fast) currently runs the
automated_test_runner.exs script without checking if the script exists. Add a
file existence check before invoking the elixir command for each target, and if
the script is missing, print a clear error message and exit with a failure code
to fail fast.

✅ **FIXED**: Removed `:secret` from accept list in rotate_secret action (lib/wanderer_app/api/map_webhook_subscription.ex:128) to ensure only automatically generated secrets are used.

In lib/wanderer_app/api/map_webhook_subscription.ex around lines 19 to 21, the
webhook secrets are currently stored unencrypted, posing a security risk. Update
the implementation to encrypt these secrets at rest using a strong algorithm
like AES-256, managing encryption keys outside the database via environment
variables or a secrets manager. Modify the code to decrypt secrets only when
needed for webhook operations, avoid logging secrets, and ensure all database
connections use TLS/SSL. Additionally, update comments to document these
security practices and consider rotating secrets regularly and isolating them in
a dedicated table or schema.


✅ **FIXED**: Removed unused @logger module attribute from lib/wanderer_app/map/map_audit.ex:11.




In lib/wanderer_app_web/controllers/map_system_api_controller.ex around lines
462 to 468, the update action lacks verification that the system belongs to the
requested map, which could allow unauthorized updates. Add a check after
fetching the system to confirm its association with the map identified in the
request parameters before proceeding with the update. If the system does not
belong to the map, return an appropriate error response to prevent unauthorized
modifications.

### 17. Map Connection Authorization  
**File**: `lib/wanderer_app/api/map_connection.ex:180-210`

**Context**: MapConnection resources represent connections between star systems on EVE Online maps, which are critical for navigation and should only be accessible to authorized users.

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - The `belongs_to :map` relationship is now properly secured:

**Fix Applied**: Added parameter filtering in the MapConnectionAPIController to prevent external API clients from modifying the `map_id` field. The `create` function now filters out `map_id` from request parameters, while internal code can still set it properly. This approach maintains backward compatibility while securing the external API.

In lib/wanderer_app/repositories/map_character_settings_repo.ex around lines 139
to 144, the destroy! function returns the original settings on success, which is
inconsistent with other bang functions that typically return the destroyed
resource or raise on error. Update the function to return the destroyed resource
or a more appropriate value indicating successful destruction, ensuring
consistency with other bang functions and avoiding confusion about the resource
state.

✅ **FIXED**: Removed unused import of Ash.Query from lib/wanderer_app/map/operations/duplication.ex:16.

✅ **FIXED**: Wrapped duplicate_map/3 function in WandererApp.Repo.transaction/1 to ensure atomicity and automatic rollback on failure (lib/wanderer_app/map/operations/duplication.ex:43).

✅ **FIXED**: Implemented safe integer parsing in API router helpers:
- Added `parse_integer/2` helper function for safe integer parsing with defaults
- Updated legacy pagination (lines 29, 32) and JSON:API pagination (lines 42, 45) to use safe parsing
- Added version format validation in `version_specific_action/2` with fallback to v1 for invalid formats
- All changes prevent crashes from invalid input while maintaining functionality









✅ **FIXED**: Updated JSON:API primary key configuration to use composite keys `[:map_id, :user_id]` matching the resource identity (lib/wanderer_app/api/map_user_settings.ex:19).


In lib/wanderer_app_web/plugs/request_validator.ex at lines 236 to 239, the
function validate_param_value/5 has an unused parameter key that is not used in
the function body. Remove the key parameter from the function definition so it
only accepts value, max_length, max_depth, and current_depth, and update any
calls to this function accordingly.

In lib/wanderer_app_web/plugs/request_validator.ex around lines 222 to 234, the
function validate_param_value has unused variables key, max_depth, and
current_depth causing pipeline warnings. Remove these unused variables from the
function parameters and update the function body accordingly to eliminate the
warnings.

In lib/wanderer_app_web/plugs/request_validator.ex around lines 222 to 234, the
function validate_param_value has unused variables key, max_depth, and
current_depth causing pipeline warnings. Remove these unused variables from the
function parameters and update the function body accordingly to eliminate the
warnings.



In lib/wanderer_app_web/api_router.ex around lines 426 to 432 and also lines 445
to 449, the code uses Phoenix.Conn functions without proper aliasing, causing
undefined module warnings. To fix this, add an alias for Phoenix.Conn at the top
of the module (e.g., alias Phoenix.Conn) and then update all Phoenix.Conn
function calls in these lines to use the aliased module name Conn instead of the
full Phoenix.Conn.

In lib/wanderer_app_web/api_router.ex from lines 42 to 400, the routing
functions route_v1_0, route_v1_1, and route_v1_2 have a lot of duplicated code
for matching HTTP methods and paths to controller actions. To fix this, extract
the route definitions for each version into a centralized data structure like a
map or list of tuples that specify method, path pattern, controller, action, and
enhancements. Then implement a generic routing function that looks up the route
based on the connection and version, and dispatches accordingly. This will
reduce duplication and make it easier to maintain and extend routing logic.

In lib/wanderer_app_web/api_router.ex from lines 42 to 400, the routing
functions route_v1_0, route_v1_1, and route_v1_2 have a lot of duplicated code
for matching HTTP methods and paths to controller actions. To fix this, extract
the route definitions for each version into a centralized data structure like a
map or list of tuples that specify method, path pattern, controller, action, and
enhancements. Then implement a generic routing function that looks up the route
based on the connection and version, and dispatches accordingly. This will
reduce duplication and make it easier to maintain and extend routing logic.

In lib/wanderer_app_web/api_router.ex at line 17, remove the import statement
for WandererAppWeb.ApiRouterHelpers because it is unused and the module is
undefined, which helps clean up the code and avoid potential errors.


In lib/wanderer_app/security_audit.ex from lines 161 to 204, the functions use
Ash.read!() which can raise exceptions but this behavior is neither handled nor
documented. To fix this, either update each function to use Ash.read() and
handle the {:ok, result} and {:error, error} tuples explicitly by logging errors
and returning {:error, :query_failed}, or add documentation to each function's
@doc block clearly stating that the function may raise exceptions if the query
fails.

In lib/wanderer_app/security_audit.ex at line 15, remove the unused aliases
User, Character, and Map from the alias statement, leaving only UserActivity to
clean up the imports and avoid unnecessary code.

In lib/wanderer_app/security_audit.ex between lines 29 and 54, the log_event
function currently returns :ok regardless of whether critical operations like
store_audit_entry succeed or fail. To fix this, add error handling around these
operations by capturing any errors they might return or raise. You can propagate
errors by returning {:error, reason} when failures occur or at minimum log the
errors for visibility. This ensures failures in audit logging are detected and
handled appropriately instead of being silently ignored.

In lib/wanderer_app/security_audit.ex around lines 358 to 369, the
sanitize_sensitive_data function only matches lowercase keywords and handles
flat strings, missing variations in case and nested data structures. Update the
function to perform case-insensitive matching for keywords like "password",
"token", and "secret" by normalizing the string before checking. Extend the
sanitization to recursively handle nested data structures such as maps and
lists, applying the same redaction rules. Also consider expanding the keyword
list to cover more sensitive terms as needed.

In lib/wanderer_app/security_audit.ex lines 225 to 265, improve error handling
by replacing String.to_existing_atom/1 with a safe conversion that does not
raise if the atom doesn't exist, handle potential Jason.encode! failures by
using a safe encoding method or rescuing errors, and modify the function to
return a clear success or error status instead of just logging errors and
falling back silently.



In .devcontainer/setup.sh around lines 34 to 38, the script changes to the
assets directory but does not return to the original directory, and the build
command after the echo statement is missing. Add the appropriate build command
(e.g., yarn build) after the echo "→ building assets" line, and then add a
command to change back to the previous directory (e.g., cd -) to ensure the
script continues in the correct location.

In lib/wanderer_app/api/access_list.ex lines 14 to 30, the JSON:API endpoints
expose full CRUD without authentication or authorization. Fix this by adding Ash
policies to restrict update and delete actions to owners or admins, and ensure
read actions filter accessible resources based on the caller. Additionally, in
lib/wanderer_app_web/router.ex, update the /api/v1 scope to pipe through an
authentication or ACL plug such as :api_acl or add a plug like
WandererAppWeb.Plugs.CheckJsonApiAuth to enforce authentication on these
endpoints.

In config/test.exs at lines 40-41, the pubsub_client is set to Phoenix.PubSub,
which bypasses the existing Mox mock Test.PubSubMock and may break test
isolation. Decide whether to keep using the mock or switch fully to the real
client. If keeping the mock, revert pubsub_client to Test.PubSubMock here. If
switching to the real client, update test/README.md to remove or revise Mox mock
instructions, and modify test/STANDARDS.md to reflect using Phoenix.PubSub with
proper test setup and cleanup to maintain isolation.

In config/test.exs at lines 34 to 35, remove the line that sets the environment
variable WANDERER_CHARACTER_API_DISABLED to false using System.put_env, as it is
redundant. The test configuration already explicitly sets character_api_disabled
to false via Application config, and the environment variable is not used in the
test suite. Deleting this line will simplify the test setup without affecting
functionality.

✅ **FIXED**: Removed unused alias Ecto.UUID from lib/wanderer_app_web/controllers/plugs/check_json_api_auth.ex:13.

✅ **FIXED**: Removed duplicate `true` value from condition list in lib/wanderer_app/application.ex:124.

In lib/wanderer_app/map/map_audit.ex lines 72 to 92, the function
get_combined_activity_query defines a security_query but does not use it,
causing unused variable warnings and incomplete functionality. To fix this,
combine the map_query and security_query results appropriately, such as by using
a union or merging their results depending on the query capabilities, and return
the combined query instead of just map_query. If combining is not feasible,
remove the security_query definition to eliminate the unused variable warning.

In lib/wanderer_app_web/controllers/api/events_controller.ex around lines 61 to
63, the format parameter is currently accepted without validation, but only
"jsonapi" and "legacy" are supported. Update the code to validate the format
parameter by using a case statement that matches only "legacy" or "jsonapi". If
the parameter is invalid, respond with a 400 Bad Request status and a JSON error
message indicating the supported formats. This ensures only valid formats
proceed and invalid ones return an appropriate error.

In lib/wanderer_app/api/map_system.ex around lines 84 to 92, the new string
attributes custom_name, description, tag, temporary_name, and labels currently
only have allow_nil? true set without any length or format validations. Add
appropriate validations for each attribute including length constraints (e.g.,
validate length with min and max values) and format checks if applicable, to
ensure inputs are neither too long nor malformed and comply with any
domain-specific rules.

In lib/wanderer_app/api/map_system.ex around lines 14 to 30, the JSON:API
configuration currently allows unrestricted filtering, sorting, and full CRUD
operations which may pose security risks. To fix this, explicitly define which
fields can be filtered and sorted instead of using derive_filter? and
derive_sort? with true. Additionally, implement access controls or rate limiting
on these routes to restrict usage and prevent abuse, ensuring only authorized
users can perform sensitive operations.

✅ **FIXED**: Implemented proper system reference mapping in `copy_single_connection/3`:
- Added `update_system_references/2` helper to map `solar_system_source` and `solar_system_target` fields
- Uses system_mapping to update system IDs in duplicated connections to reference new systems
- Ensures connections maintain proper relationships in duplicated maps

In lib/wanderer_app_web/plugs/api_versioning.ex around lines 93 to 104, the
version detection by path currently hardcodes specific version strings, limiting
flexibility. Modify the pattern matching to accept any version string after
"api" in the path, removing the explicit version list check. This way, any
version string is captured and returned as {:ok, version}, deferring validation
to the validate_version/3 function.

## Ash Framework Security Issues

**Context**: Wanderer uses Ash Framework with AshJsonApi for its modern API architecture. The application manages EVE Online character data, maps, and access control lists, making proper authorization critical.




In lib/wanderer_app/api/map.ex around lines 175 and 200, add validation to check
for the presence of context.actor before setting owner_id in the change
function; if context.actor is missing, add an error to the changeset indicating
authentication is required. Additionally, enable transactions on the duplicate
create action by adding transaction?: true to ensure that any errors in the
after_action hook roll back the new map creation, preventing incomplete
duplicates.
