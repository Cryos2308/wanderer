To accommodate the obscene power needs, a full two-thirds of the crew space is replaced with additional power generators. Ironically, the ship's advanced composition also makes it a tempting target for many capsuleers, as Dark Blood Hunter wreckage often contains advanced modules exclusive to the Blood Raider Covenant.<br>

SARO ships had a sizable Serpentis fleet on the run, until a commander in this Vindicator variant entered the scene. The resilience and coordination abilities of the vessel led several SARO agents on scene to name it the “Big Boss,” a name which has come to be attached to the entire variant line.<br>

Although the document is not required by CONCORD police or empire law, it significantly adds to the employment prospects of a newly-graduated capsuleer. Throughout repeated surveys and tests one common pattern emerges; those capsuleers who complete this basic training and other more advanced courses have a much higher chance of employment with other capsuleer corporations, and generally finds themselves more confident and knowledgeable in the often turbulent and confusing first few days of becoming a full-fledged capsuleer.

4005,27,Scorpion Ishukone Watch,"With its focus on electronic warfare, few ships can resist the direct onslaught of the Ishukone Watch Scorpion-class battleship's jamming capabilities.
 
<font color=white><u>Details</u></font>
This variant of the Scorpion represents the pinnacle of the Ishukone paramilitary force's electronic warfare capabilities.
 
<font color=white><u>Development</u></font>
When Ishukone Watch was commissioned to produce a run of Scorpion-class battleships for its parent company, it was decided that a number of extra units would be offered to the capsuleer community to help fund the effort. Interestingly, the entire project took less than one year from start to finish, suggesting at some degree of urgency in the fleet's production.

The first of these vessels was awarded to Gallente pilot Jack DuVal on June 4th YC115 as a gesture of good will, after it was stolen from an Ishukone Watch shipyard in orbit of Caldari Prime by the Guristas Pirates, before being abandoned in his hangar in Korama after a lengthy pursuit across the Caldari Border Zone.
 
<font color=white><u>Technology</u></font>
Though the typical Scorpion-class battleship includes a highly advanced sensor package, Ishukone Watch modifies their ships for policing duty around their worlds. Custom multispectral radiation scanners designed to catch all forms of planetary and extra-planetary communications replace the standard comms suite. Special Ladar and thermal imaging equipment allow Ishukone Watch ships to serve as a distant eye-in-the-sky for planetary security forces. Although these features are stripped out before decommissioned hulls are placed on the open market, the infamy of the Ishukone Watch still makes ships popular with independent ship buyers.

<font color=white><u>Notes</u></font>
Many wonder why Ishukone Watch would produce a massive run of electronic warfare battleships, especially with sensor suites fine-tuned to detect planetside signals. Some have speculated that these ships were intended to support a larger, multinational fleet. Regarding the mass production of these ships, Ishukone Watch CEO Eborimi Shiskala praised her parent corporation with an ""incredible dedication to the Ishukone doctrine of technological superiority.""",103600000.0000000000,468000.0000000000,550.0000000000,1,1,71250000.0000,0,1620,None,20068,11536

What is most impressive is that, beyond a handful of experimental Angel technologies, the Grigori's advantage comes almost exclusively from employing an all-veteran crew.  The efficiency and skill a Grigori crew brings to battle can rival those of a capsuleer. Luckily, the loss of a Grigori crew can be extremely demoralizing for local Cartel forces, leading them to eventually abandon complexes where a Grigori was destroyed.<br>

4011,319,Reinforced Drone Bunker,"<font color=yellow>Subject:</font> Reinforced Drone Bunker<br>
<font color=yellow>Summary:</font> This structure appears similar to classic drone bunkers, but is heavily  modified to withstand direct attack. <br>
<font color=yellow>Additional Intelligence:</font> First appearing in YC 113, the reinforced drone bunker is an incredibly sturdy variant of the classic rogue drone bunker design. The outer hull itself is bolstered by a honeycombed mesh of tritanium-tungsten alloy, preventing breaches from tears or blunt impact. Internal systems are supplemented with multiple redundancies. <br>
The nature of rogue drones makes it difficult to determine if these improvements are the result of conscious effort or, as some engineers theorize, a sort of natural selection after years of losing traditional bunkers to capsuleer raids.<br>

<font color=yellow>Additional Intelligence:</font> First encountered in YC112, the Irregular is an attack frigate modified for fast assault and first response action. A <a href=showinfo:34>tritanium</a>-reinforced hull improves survivability, as does an experimental Guristas Production Atlas capacitor. Each Irregular is, ironically, crewed by seasoned combat veterans. The average total experience of an Irregular crew is 90 years. This experience gap gives the Irregular an 83% higher survivability rating than the average Guristas frigate crew.<br>

The Dark Blood Alpha is crewed almost exclusively by veterans of past raids, making this ship the most dangerous opponent on the field. <br>
